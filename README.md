# Sample-Projects
Projects displaying various skills

The purpose of this is to show a variety of various programs I have coded, including some simple implementatation making my own .lower() method, use of file creations in python, regex and so on.  These are mostly small side programs, my bigger ones are in the large project repos.  This is mostly my use of some various modules available in python.
